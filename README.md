# REST API Example for ESP8266

Using an ESP8266 to connect to Wi-Fi, this code uses an API GET request to a public server that allows for tracking of both a public IP (provided in code) and your own IP address (using whatsmyip.com or equivalent)

See comments in code for more information.

# Notes
- You must install all necessary libraries (can be installed using standard Sketch -> Include library -> Manage libraies method through Arduino IDE) 

# TODO
- Add POST functionality to ESP8266 code
