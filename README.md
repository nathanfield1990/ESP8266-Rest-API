REST API usage using an ESP8266

Using an ESP8266 and connecting to Wi-Fi it uses a API GET request to a public server that allows for tracking of both a public IP (provided) and your own IP address (using whatsmyip.com or equivalent)

See comments in code for more information, and enjoy :)

# TODO
