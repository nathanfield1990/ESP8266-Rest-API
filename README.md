# REST API Example for ESP8266

See the Arduino code to use a ESP8266 to do the following:
 - Gets the ESP IP address from one pulic API (https://api.ipify.org)
 - Gets the ESP location based on it's public IP from another public API (https://ipapi.co/)
 - Send the location data to a server using POST to a public POSTMAN API, which is echoed back to prove it was received (http://postman-echo.com/post)

See comments in code for more information.

# Notes
- You must install all necessary libraries (can be installed using standard Sketch -> Include library -> Manage libraies method through Arduino IDE)
